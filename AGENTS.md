# Agent workflow

Instructions for the AI agent working in this repo.

## Diagrams

- **Use Mermaid** — Whenever you are asked to create or add a diagram (architecture, flow, sequence, etc.), use [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) syntax in fenced code blocks (`` ```mermaid ``) rather than ASCII art. Mermaid renders in GitHub, GitLab, and many docs tools.

## After every prompt

1. **Update the README** — If the code, behavior, or setup changed in a way users should know about, update `README.md` accordingly.
2. **Commit and push** — Commit the changes (including any README updates) and push to the remote.
